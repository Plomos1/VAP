<h2>More Things</h2>
<p>Soon to be Famous™ Chicken Fingers</p>
<p>We hand-cut our chicken fingers on site every day. We also bread each finger by hand and blend our batter by hand. When it comes to fingers, we're very hands on.</p>
<p>Crinkle-Cut Fries</p>
<p>We cook with state-of-the-art fryers that give our fries a golden-brown crisp on the outside with a soft, fluffy center every time. If you haven’t tried them with our Secret Sauce, you’re missing out.</p>
<p>Texas Toast</p>
<p>Our Texas Toast is made with Mrs. Baird’s bread seasoned with a blend of butter and garlic that we apply by hand. We use a flat-top grill to seal in the flavor and leave each side with a slightly crispy finish.</p>
<p>Secret Sauce</p>
<p>Tangy, spicy, zesty, peppery, and perfectly balanced. The more you savor each bite, the more flavors you’ll discover. If you want to know the recipe, you’ll have to rely on your taste buds, because our lips are sealed.</p>
<p>Potato Salad</p>
<p>Our Potato Salad is a natural companion to the rest of our menu. A creamy blend of potatoes, vegetables and herbs prepared in house and served cold.</p>
<p>**Menu may vary by store.</p>
