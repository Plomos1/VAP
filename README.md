# Visual-Access-Project

Why is The Visual Access Project Here?

I have created this site and started this project because I believe that everyone should have the opportunity to have the same life experiences regardless of what their abilities may be. It became painfully obvious to me that resources for people living with visual challenges in many areas are lacking. Because of this I decided to team up with a visual adaptation specialist to provide this project as a free resource to those with visual impairments so they may more fully enjoy life.

This is also intended as a Community Development project. That means that I am taking the knowledge of my visual adaptation specialist, and combining with the work that has already been done to create the original versions of menus or other items to provide an overall resource that is better than what could be achieved individually by the visually impaired community or the resources on their own. This is also part of why suggestions and requests are welcome, because it cannot be built properly without community input.

This repository is intended to allow users of the project to see how often updates are being made to the content of the project. Once menus or recipes are completed here they will be added to the website. Copyright 2018 - 2020 Visual Access Project. All Rights Reserved.
