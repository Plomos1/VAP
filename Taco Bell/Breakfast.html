<p> All the Cravings. Covered.  Grande Toasted Breakfast Burrito is a giant leap for breakfast kind

When your alarm goes off, there’s nothing you want more than to stay bundled up nice and cozy under your covers. We get that. But what if we told you that the stuff-of-dreams Grande Toasted Breakfast Burrito with steak actually has more in common with those sheets than you might realize? Getting one will make the getting-out-of-bed transition easier for you. Here’s the logic.
Think about it, the tortilla is nothing if not a blanket keeping all the warm goodness inside. Exhibit B: People, us included, refer to perfectly prepared scrambled eggs as ‘pillowy’. This choice of word can’t be a coincidence.
But perhaps the most important comparison that can be made between bedding and the Grande Toasted Breakfast Burrito? Thread count. In both cases, bigger is undoubtedly better. And we’ve put everything into weaving this delicious breakfast creation (at participating locations during breakfast hours only). Let’s count ‘em up:
It starts with the steak.Then double the eggs*. Potato bites. Pico de gallo. And three melty cheeses to bring it all together and toasted to perfection.
Many have tried, but there’s really no sleeping on the Grande Toasted Breakfast Burrito with steak.</p>

<p> Circles are for Squares.  OK not all circles; just the ones that you eat for breakfast. But we know one breakfast item that is most definitely not a square. The Breakfast Crunchwrap®.

Ever since breakfast has existed, it’s existed in the form of a circle sandwich. We know this, you know this, and everyone knows this. It’s a little played out if we’re being honest. And breakfast has basically existed since someone decided to eat food in the morning, which makes the standard circle breakfast sandwich undeniably outdated. We mean, really outdated. Just think how far back that dates? People have been eating food in the mornings forever. Therefore, breakfast has been around forever. Since the standard circle breakfast has been around for a while, we here at Taco Bell thought we would mix it up and bring some excitement back to breakfast. This is why we now have the Breakfast Crunchwrap®. Eggs, your choice of bacon or sausage, real cheddar cheese, creamy jalapeño sauce and a full hash brown in a very hexagonal, handheld breakfast. It’s the motorcycle to the penny-farthing. The Internet to the carrier pigeon. The lantern to the lamp. The mobile phone to the payphone. A payphone, you ask? See, you don’t even remember those things because it’s been so long ago. Our point was just proven. The circle breakfast sandwich is as outdated as a payphone. It’s all about the Crunchwrap. And one step further, it’s all about the Breakfast Crunchwrap®.

So basically what we’re saying is, to all you devout fans of the circle breakfast sandwich, you’re lame and need to get with the now. And the Breakfast Crunchwrap® is the now. We’d be worried about upsetting you circle sandwich fans out there, but this description will probably never be on daytime AM radio, so they won’t even hear this in the first place anyway.</p>

<p>The reason bowls were invented.  There’s no way the inventor of the bowl could have imagined such a use for his creation when he carved the first stone bowl some 10,000,000 years ago. But here comes the Mini Skillet Bowl which totally changes the game.

With its breakfast potatoes, scrambled eggs, nacho cheese sauce and pico de gallo, it’s so exotic and so tasty. And all for just a buck. Don’t believe us? Well, not only is that rude, because we would never lie to you, but what do you think bowls were even invented for? This. This is what the bowl was destined for, and we like to think that if this genius of a caveman took just one bite he’d know the magic that he had inspired when the Mini Skillet Bowl was created. He’d probably be so proud. No, not probably, scratch that. We know he’d be proud. He’d wish he was around this glorious time so he can see his work put to the best use there is which is with the Mini Skillet Bowl. But then when you think about it, what if the caveman who invented the bowl was not around back millions of years ago and never created the bowl? What if the caveman was around today? Would we not have bowls? Would there be another innovative human being sometime before now who would have created the bowl to house our beloved Mini Skillet Bowl? So many questions. So many what ifs! Phew- just a minor tangent. We’re good now. We believe the bowl would have in some way been created. By who? We don’t know exactly. But it would have been created and that’s all that matters. Because what matters more is that the Mini Skillet Bowl still exists and you can get yourself one today. Right now. Make the caveman proud of you for your decision.</p>
<h3>Hash Brown $1</h3>
<p>160 cal</p>
<br>
<p>Everyone Knows a Good Patty.  It's funny how certain names almost always stick up for their stereotypes and the Hash Brown is no different.

For instance, when you meet a “Dwayne,” you immediately know that he probably worked at a record store or used guitar repair shop at some point in his life. If you even mention a band from between 1975 to 1990, you better be ready for a hazy concert anecdote that takes place in a Midwestern parking lot. Or if you meet a “Jon-Luc,” do yourself a favor and ask him where to find a good bakery, because it’s all but certain he knows where to find the freshest baguette in every town. Pro tip- he’s someone you’ll want to have on speed dial to hook you up with the best recommendations. Bet he even knows where to get the best Hash Brown (hint, you’re reading about it right now). Or if you find yourself meeting a “Sam,” he was probably the hot shot ballplayer in high school who played one game but still wears his letterman jacket to every home game…ten years later. Or “Patty,” for instance. Every Patty is a straight shooter with heart like a diamond. If she’s not your favorite coworker, she’s probably your favorite aunt. Not your favorite aunt, then she’s definitely your favorite neighbor, for sure. And like our Hash Brown Patty, she’s also criminally undervalued because of her consistent good vibes. In the same way that there’s a Patty breaking up the awkward silence at every family reunion, there’s a Hash Brown Patty bringing some extra flavor to every good breakfast. The only real difference between ours and every other Patty is that while your Aunt Pat may be sweet, fun, and good-natured, she also knows how to put you in your place. For every Dwayne who thinks that disco sucks, there’s a Patty who will put you in an armbar for one crass comment about her sister.</p>
<h3>Cinnabon Delights® 12 Pack $4.99</h3>

<p>Dessert, disguised as breakfast, disguised as dessert.  Sorry to tell you, buddy, but you’ve been had. Cinnabon Delights® are a thing. And they can play some serious mind games.

You thought you were eating breakfast, but then you put this thing in your mouth and WOAH, cinnamon spheres filled with icing is obviously dessert, not breakfast. Oh, were you one of the clever ones who had a hearty meal of lunchtime tacos followed up by a few Cinnabon Delights® for dessert? Nice try, but you’ve been conned my friend- they’re a breakfast item. Dessert for breakfast for dessert, the oldest trick in the book. But we aren’t hating. Nope. No hater here.

The Cinnabon Delights® are the perfect excuse for you to have, what some would call, desserts for breakfast because they are totally a breakfast item. Don’t be fooled, they’re not a dessert item. Remember when you were little and ice cream, cookies, brownies- basically anything sweet was all you ever wanted? Well, has that really changed since? We’re not judging. We get it. Anyways, with the Cinnabon Delights®, you can totally get your sweet fix on in the morning. It’s true. “Dessert” for breakfast. What could be better? Well, we can kind of one up that one. Because Cinnabon Delights® are actually the perfect excuse to have your sweet fix at any time of the day. You know when your mom would always say “no dessert before dinner”. Well, sorry, mama. Jokes on you with this one. Because it’s actually not a dessert. You should be in the clear with that excuse. We’re not entirely sure you will or not, but we think you could get by with it. If that doesn’t work, then just suggest to your mom about switching it up a bit. Have breakfast for dinner instead. That for sure will pass.

Cinnabon Delights® are basically that clutch breakfast item that will be delightfully delicious anytime of the day. But like we said, it’s a breakfast item. So you can totally have “dessert” with breakfast when you get yourself some of these Cinnabon Delights®.

<h3>Mountain Dew® Kickstart™ Orange Citrus - Small $1</h3>
<p>70 cal</p>
<br>
<p>Show Morning Who’s Boss.  If you’re living life the way you’re supposed to, morning is always going to be a struggle. That’s why there’s the Mountain Dew® Kickstart™ to help kick start your mornings.

It’s like the worst bully of all time, just picking on you when you’re most vulnerable, too tired to fight back. Especially those pesky Mondays. What did we ever do to Monday’s anyways to treat us so rough? Sure we could be to blame partially for having an adventure filled, jam packed Sunday right before Monday. But it’s not our fault we’re awesome and don’t want to waste a perfectly good Sunday. But the Mountain Dew® Kickstart™ gets us type of people. The slow wakers, the constant snoozers, the sleep through 4 alarm clocks, or the mom busting through our room to wake us and tell us we have 15 minutes until school starts. Whatever though, right. This is why Mountain Dew® Kickstart™ exists, to give you the energy to fight through the fatigue and punch morning right in its little 8 A.M. smack-talking mouth. So we don’t have to worry anymore about those dreaded Mondays. We can look at them square in the eye, with no intimidation (as long as we have a Mountain dew® Kickstart™ in hand of course) and be ready for whatever nonsense Monday may bring our way. Monday blues have nothing on us. Since we have our sidekick handy, we’re ready for anything. Nothing can bring us down on a Monday morning. Unless, you don’t have time to get yourself a Mountain Dew® Kickstart™ on a Monday. Then you may be out of luck there. Good luck trying to survive a Monday without it. We’re all rooting for you! But in all seriousness, we would make the time to get ourselves a Mountain Dew® Kickstart™- it’s an essential any day of the week, but especially on Mondays.
