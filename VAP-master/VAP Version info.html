<center><strong><h2>VAP Version: 22.1</h2></strong></center>
<br>
<p>The VAP Version number is a representation of progress made on the content of the project. The Visual Access Project (VAP) consists of major version updates like entire menus and other smaller updates. As an example, adding a menu for the very first time established version 1.0. Updating the content of that menu would have established version 1.1 while a minor upgrade to the back end of the site would establish version 1.1.1. As the project grows the version number will change and you will be able to see details in the Update Log section of this page.</p>
