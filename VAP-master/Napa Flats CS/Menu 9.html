<p>We created Napa Flats Wood-Fired Kitchen to celebrate our love of fresh, homemade food, great beverages, and remarkable desserts. We wanted a menu that was familiar without being common. We wanted to provide catering that was unique and memorable. But most of all, we wanted to create an experience you would be proud to share with your family and friends. - Thomas W.
