<h2>Steps</h2>
<h3>Step 1 - Prep</h3>
<p>Wash and dry all produce. Cut lime into wedges. Finely dice tomato. Peel and finely dice kiwi. Halve, peel, and thinly slice onion; mince a few slices until you have 2 TBSP (3 TBSP for 4 servings). Roughly chop cilantro leaves and stems. Core, deseed, and finely chop poblano</p>
<h2>Step 2 - Make Crema & Salsa</h2>
<p>In a small bowl, combine sour cream and a squeeze of lime juice. Stir in water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency. Season with salt and pepper. In a medium bowl, toss together tomato, kiwi, minced onion, half the cilantro, and a squeeze of lime juice. Season with salt and pepper.</p>
<h2>Step 3 - Cook Veggies</h2>
<p>Heat a large drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add poblano, sliced onion, and half the Mexican Spice. (you'll use the rest later). Cook, stirring occasionally, until veggies are softened and lightly charred, 3-4 minutes</p>
<h2>Step 4 - Cook Pork</h2>
<p>Add pork, another large drizzle of oil, and remaining Mexican Spice to pan. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until pork is browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat under pan to medium-low. Tip: If there is excess grease in your pan, carefully pour it out.</p>
<h2>Step 5 - Finish Filling</h2>
<p>Stir in stock concentrate, 1/4 cup water (1/3 cup for 4 servings), and tomato paste. Cook, stirring, until everything is coated in a thick sauce, 1-2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</p>
<h2>Step 6 - Finish & Serve</h2>
<p>Wrap tortillas in damp paper towels and microwave until warm and pliable, 30 seconds. Divide pork filling, salsa, and crema between tortillas. Sprinkle with remaining cilantro. Serve with remaining lime wedges on the side</p>
